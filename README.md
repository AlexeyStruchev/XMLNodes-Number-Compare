## XMLNodes Number Compare

<p>Compare XML nodes number in a xml file (or files) with a product description in English with file (or files) in
a different language (or languages).Let there be an xml file with a product description.</p> 
The structure of the file is Feed / Product / "Nodes of third level". Assume that there can be many nodes of third level. 
    In turn there can be many child levels of third level. And one file can contain many products. 
The file contains a description in English. And there is another file that contains a description in Spain.    There is a need to check if the number of nodes is the same in these files because a system which prepares them
can have defects. If there are a lot of products in a file and there are a lot of nodes of third level 
manual comparison is quite difficult. In this case this utility can help to perform fast automated comparison. 
    The utility works with at least 2 files with different languages and also can work with many files.
