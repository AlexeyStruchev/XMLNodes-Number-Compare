## XMLNodes Number Compare

Compare XML nodes number in a xml file (or files) with a product description in English with file (or files) in a different language (or languages).

Let there be an xml file with a product description.

The structure of the file is Feed / Product / "Nodes of third level". Assume that there can be many nodes of third level.

In turn, there can be many child levels of third level. In addition, one file can contain many products.

The file contains a description in English. Moreover, another file contains a description in Spain. 

There is a need to check if the number of nodes is the same in these files because a system that prepares them can have defects.

If there are many products in a file and there are many nodes of third level manual counting is quite difficult.

In this case, this utility helps to perform a fast comparison.

The utility works with at least two files with different languages and can work with many files.

There is a message in terminal is printed out if there is a different number of nodes with a path to the nodes.
