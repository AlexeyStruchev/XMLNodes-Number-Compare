## XMLNodes Number Compare

<p>Compare XML nodes number in a xml file (or files) with a product description in English with file (or files) in
a different language (or languages). 
<p>Let there be a xml file with a product description.</p> 
<p>The structure of the file is Feed / Product / "Nodes of third level". Assume that there can be many nodes of third level.</p> 
<p>In turn there can be many child levels of third level. And one file can contain many products.</p> 
<p>The file contains a description in English. And there is another file that contains a description in Spain.    
There is a need to check if the number of nodes is the same in these files because a system which prepares them
can have defects.</p>
<p>If there are a lot of products in a file and there are a lot of nodes of third level manual counting is quite difficult.</p>
<p>In this case this utility helps to perform fast automated comparison.</p> 
<p>The utility works with at least 2 files with different languages and also can work with many files.</p>
<p>There is a message in terminal is printed with path to nodes where there is a different number of nodes</p>
